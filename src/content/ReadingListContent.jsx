                Once again "Uncle Bob" puts a fine point on code hygene and a disciplined approach to design. In particular I love the concept of software not just symbolizing or documenting a company's policies and procedures but actually being the policies themself! A computer implements policy based on how it was designed without personal bias or exception. Of course the danger is that decisions that are automated might never be reviewed by a human who has the capacity for understanding the big picture and the messy context of life itself. At the end of the day humans are the how and why of any software and that technology must never take precedence over the lives it affects.

                LEAN is an amazing methodology that addresses the extreme leverage the developer has over outcomes. Decisions made today have a compounding effect and given the pace of development flaws in the system become tech debt that will have to compete with new initiatives. As a result quality must be built in from the beginning. This gives rise to concepts like delayed decision making until as much is known as possible. That way the best decision is made and does not need to be revisited because new information comes to light. Of course perfect decisions require the kind of hindsight that is not available to the decision maker and so flexibility is key. Overall, LEAN methodology fosters quality and adaptability that will live long after the original decisions have been made.

                Kim Scott lays out a beautiful framework for empowering a culture of empathy and productivity by focusing on direct communication and understanding of the humans involved. Most of us have walked around with our fly down or mustard on our chin. When we realize all of our friends were too embarrassed to point out our blind spot we have been walking around drawing attention for a lot longer than we should have been. However, when a rival shames us for something we didn't realize we were doing we feel defensive and not open to feedback. The balance comes when we speak directly and empathetically. Obviously this has business application but it has an equally powerful affect on our personsal relationships.

                Empathy is extremely important, but it can also be paralyzing. We only have so much in our emotional reserve and when it runs out we can't respond to life's many demands. Being mindful about how we invest our emotional capital can free us up to care about the things we actually do value.

                Jordan Ellenberg explores axiomatic learning, or building on what we already know (axioms). Challenging axioms can lead to new insights in an ever evolving understanding of what is true while identifying what only seems true when unchallenged.

                This was a course on Audible broken up into bite-sized lessons. Some of the most interesting insights are in the definition of complexity which he describes as a system composed of individual agents making decisions based on decisions made by other individual agents. This creates a constantly shifting landscape that is shaped less like the Apalachean Range of "complicated" peaks and valleys and not at all like Mt. Fuji with "simple" slopes that all lead to the top, and more like a lake whose "complex" waves are constantly cresting and dissipating relative to the waves immediately next to them.

                I enjoyed his course on complexity so much that I went in for another. In this course we discusses the benefits of diversity from a variety of perspectives. Gender diversity brings the strengths of men, women and non-binary individuals to bear while cultural diversity opens up the individuals from all corners of the globe to bring their power to problem solving. All of his examples point to the true value which is diversity of perspective and life experiences. Women have had to navigate a different set of obstacles than men; black people a different set than white; foreigners a defferent set still than natural born citizens. All of these forms of diversity are a proxy for what is truly important. When understood in this way diversity can bring together problem solving strategies not available to those who have experienced life differently. In the end diversity has the capacity to solve a much larger set of problems.

                Human nature leads us to seek comfort. 100 years ago that meant having a fireplace in your house and herbs and spices on your food. 10000 years ago that meant sitting by the fire after chasing prey with a spear. In the past comfort has pushed us to innovate the bow and arrow and the basket to collect berries. For prior generations comfort was so expensive as to be a luxury good in economic parlance and its high cost meant that not many could afford enough of it to realize its danger. Today comfort means a thermostat set to 70 degrees and the knowledge that milk and eggs are only a five minute drive away. The economic success of humanity has reduced the cost so far that the poor mental health that once only afflicted royal families has now reached the middle class.

                How do we define a concept like "quality" which is something we can all recognize; which has a lot to do with subjective experience; but can be consistently recognized by many independent observers? Why is Beethoven's Ode to Joy widely recognized as one of the greatest pieces of music to have been created? Is it because of the ebb and flow of emotion one feels while listening to it? That's even harder to pin down than quality itself. While this book was first published in the 1970's its implications have a lot to say about our current development of AI. Software lives on precise definitions. Binary is an either or. However, the complexity of Large Language Models has given us text that sounds human; art that looks human and facts that are anything BUT reliable. Given the fact that poetry generated by AI has the capacity to create a powerful emotional response in someone even when they know it was written by a machine throws our previous notions of quality writing out the window. A Robert Frost poem gains meaning and quality when one learns about the life of the man and the experiences that led to the poem. The Star Spangled Banner causes chills when one considers the first person experience of Francis Scott Key witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry during the war of 1812. What then causes the emotional reaction to AI generated art? Clearly quality is more than a subjective judgement. While many people really love Top Ramen, even they would concede that the genuine article made at a Japanese restaurant is of superior quality. Thoughts along these lines dovetail nicely with the LEAN and SOLID principals discussed above.

                Victor Wootan is widely considered to be among the greates Bassists to have ever slapped a string. In The Music Lesson he explores what it means to make good music. Similar to Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, he explores quality, but from a musical standpoint. The organization of the book bridges the gap between philosophical musings and practical advice for living a more meaningful life. Some of his highest "quality" insights are that of the 12 foundations he outlines [Groove, Notes, Articulation, Technique, Emotion, Dynamics, Rhythm, Tone, Phrasing, Space, Listening] none of them offers a golden ticket. Similar to some of the insights gained from "Understsanding Complexity" it's the interaction of these that catches our ear. Not many people would say Bob Dylan's voice has a beautiful tone and not many people would say Thelonius Monk hit every note as expected. But as many other singers with silk voices have covered Bob Dylan songs, I find myself coming back to his version with all its nasally roughness and jazz music would not be jazz if it did not take mistakes made in real time and run with them to surprising places.
