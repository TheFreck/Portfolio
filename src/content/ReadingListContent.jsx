                <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/23215733-software-craftsman-the" target="_blank">The Software Craftsman</a> is a shift in mindset and attitude. A software craftsman will take pride in their work and build quality in from the beginning. This is accomplished by keeping up to date with modern philosophies and paradigms of programming as well as keeping skills sharp through personal projects, katas and open source contributions. A craftsman will always be learning and always eager to share knowledge and insights with peers.

                In <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html" target="_blank">Clean Architecture</a> "Uncle Bob" takes a deep dive into the concept of Separation of Concerns which in a way is an extension to the <em>Single Responsibility</em> principal of SOLID. If each module is its own <em>black box</em> as it were, with its own context then the overall architecture will be simpler, cleaner and more maintainable. For each module to have its own encapsulation it will need to have access to its dependencies through <em>Inversion of Control</em>, or <em>Dependency Injection</em>, again tying back to SOLID. Organizing the code into self contained <em>"layers"</em> will ultimately lead to clean architecture.

                <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/194338.Lean_Software_Development" target="_blank">LEAN</a> is an amazing methodology that addresses the extreme leverage the developer has over outcomes. Decisions made today have a compounding effect and given the pace of development flaws in the system become tech debt that will have to compete with new initiatives. As a result quality must be built in from the beginning. This gives rise to concepts like delayed decision making until as much is known as possible. That way the best decision is made and does not need to be revisited because new information comes to light. Of course perfect decisions require the kind of hindsight that is not available to the decision maker and so flexibility is key. Overall, LEAN methodology fosters quality and adaptability that will live long after the original decisions have been made.

                <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29939161-radical-candor" target="_blank">Kim Scott</a> lays out a beautiful framework for empowering a culture of empathy and productivity by focusing on direct communication and understanding of the humans involved. Most of us have walked around with our fly down or mustard on our chin. When we realize all of our friends were too embarrassed to point out our blind spot we have been walking around drawing attention for a lot longer than we should have been. However, when a rival shames us for something we didn't realize we were doing we feel defensive and not open to feedback. The balance comes when we speak directly and empathetically. Obviously this has business application but it has an equally powerful affect on our personsal relationships.

We only have so much in our emotional reserve and when it runs out we can't respond to life's many demands. Being mindful about how we invest our emotional capital can free us up to care about the things we actually do value.

                <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46138936-understanding-complexity" target="_blank">This</a> was a course on Audible broken up into bite-sized lessons. Some of the most interesting insights are in the definition of complexity which he describes as a system composed of individual agents making decisions based on decisions made by other individual agents. This creates a constantly shifting landscape that is shaped less like the Apalachean Range of "complicated" peaks and valleys and not at all like Mt. Fuji with "simple" slopes that all lead to the top, and more like a lake whose "complex" waves are constantly cresting and dissipating relative to the waves immediately next to them.

                I enjoyed his course on complexity so much that I went in for another. In <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17912024-the-hidden-factor" target="_blank">this course</a> he discusses the benefits of diversity from a variety of perspectives. Gender diversity brings the strengths of men, women and non-binary individuals to bear while cultural diversity opens up the individuals from all corners of the globe to bring their power to problem solving. All of his examples point to the true value which is diversity of perspective and life experiences. Women have had to navigate a different set of obstacles than men; black people a different set than white; foreigners a defferent set still than natural born citizens. All of these forms of diversity are a proxy for what is truly important. When understood in this way diversity can bring together problem solving strategies not available to those who have experienced life differently. In the end diversity has the capacity to solve a much larger set of problems.

In the past comfort has pushed us to innovate the bow and arrow and the basket to collect berries. For prior generations comfort was so expensive as to be a luxury good in economic parlance and its high cost meant that not many could afford enough of it to realize its danger. Today comfort means a thermostat set to 70 degrees and the knowledge that milk and eggs are only a five minute drive away. The economic success of humanity has reduced the cost so far that the poor mental health that once only afflicted royal families has now reached the middle class.

                <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/629.Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance" target="_blank">How do we define a concept like "quality"</a> which is something we can all recognize; which has a lot to do with subjective experience; but can be consistently recognized by many independent observers? Why is Beethoven's Ode to Joy widely recognized as one of the greatest pieces of music to have been created? Is it because of the ebb and flow of emotion one feels while listening to it? That's even harder to pin down than quality itself.

                While this book was first published in the 1970's its implications have a lot to say about our current development of AI. Software lives on precise definitions. Binary is an either or. However, the complexity of Large Language Models has given us text that sounds human; art that looks human and facts that are anything BUT reliable. Given the fact that poetry generated by AI has the capacity to create a powerful emotional response in someone even when they know it was written by a machine throws our previous notions of quality writing out the window.

                A Robert Frost poem gains meaning and quality when one learns about the life of the man and the experiences that led to the poem. The Star Spangled Banner causes chills when one considers the first person experience of Francis Scott Key witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry during the war of 1812. What then causes the emotional reaction to AI generated art? Clearly quality is more than a subjective judgement. While many people really love Top Ramen, even they would concede that the genuine article made at a Japanese restaurant is of superior quality. Thoughts along these lines dovetail nicely with the LEAN and SOLID principals discussed above.

In The Music Lesson he explores what it means to make good music. Similar to Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, he explores quality, but from a musical standpoint. The organization of the book bridges the gap between philosophical musings and practical advice for living a more meaningful life. Some of his highest "quality" insights are that of the 12 foundations he outlines [Groove, Notes, Articulation, Technique, Emotion, Dynamics, Rhythm, Tone, Phrasing, Space, Listening] none of them offers a golden ticket but must be understood in combination.

                Similar to some of the insights gained from "Understsanding Complexity" it's the interaction of these that catches our ear. Not many people would say Bob Dylan's voice has a beautiful tone and not many people would say Thelonius Monk hit every note as expected. But as many other singers with silk voices have covered Bob Dylan songs, I find myself coming back to his version with all its nasally roughness and jazz music would not be jazz if it did not take mistakes made in real time and run with them to surprising places.

She takes the reader on a historical journey through the career of David Starr Jordan who catalogued nearly 1/5 fish species known to humans. Throughout his career his careful organization of specimins were ruined many times and had to be reconstituted after say the 1906 San Francisco earthquake which knocked over shelves of specimins in jars. The resilience he had to pick up the shards of his life work each time it was destroyed was one of the inspiring sub plots.

                The reason this book is so much more than a history of a controversial taxonomist is when she discusses categories. Is a lung fish a fish? It has more in common biologically with a cow than a tuna. We know that dolphins and whales are not fish yet somebody not yet familiar with out classification of mammals might not be able to understand the difference. In other words, classifications are not objective and are useful in their context. However, a different classification regime might be more useful in the long run.

The process of creation takes many years yet can be undone by large impact events over night. The author was born in Lebanon and experienced the Lebanese revolution first hand. He saw hundreds of years of development destroyed in a flash of violence. He also worked as a quantitative trader on Wallstreet and published this book mere months before the Housing Market collapsed in 2007-2008.

                Typically we would expect that 68% of the time the market would move up or down within 1 standard deviation of normal; 95% of the time is should fall within 2; 99.7% of the time it should fall within 3. In 2008 the market had many days within short periods of time that were well above those 3 standard deviations. In terms of a normal distribution these events should not happen that often.

                Taleb refers to these events as <em>Fat Tails</em>. He would suggest that the probabilities should not drop off as quickly as they do in a normal Gaussian bell curve. The tails are the right and left most sections where extremely uncommon events are. A fat tail is a modification of the standard bell curve to account for more unusual events.
