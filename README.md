# [My Portfolio](https://thefreck.github.io/Portfolio/)
This is an easy way to see and interact with projects I've worked on. I've included five sections:
## About Me
This is an intro into my personality and non programming accomplishments
## Projects
This is a small selection of my projects. There are many more that still need another coat of paint. I will add them here as I feel they are polished enough for prime time.
## Reading List
I really wanted to include this section because I have been finding some really great books lately that have enriched my thinking so much. This is the same mind I apply to software development and so if you want to get an idea of how I approach coding problems take a look.
## Endorsements
I have had the extreme pleasure of working and collaborating with some amazing engineers, software managers and project managers. I would vouch for any and all of the people in this section. The fact that they would vouch for me is humbling to say the least!
## Writing
I added a section to showcase some of my writing.
